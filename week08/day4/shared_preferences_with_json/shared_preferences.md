# Shared Preferences
- Create a new Android App
- In the `onCreate` of your MainActivity create an ArrayList of Strings.
- Fill the ArrayList with some Strings of your choice
- Convert the ArrayList to JSON using Gson (don't forget to add it to your gradle!)
- Print out the JSON
- Store the JSON in SharedPreferences
- Read the JSON back from SharedPreferences
- Create a new ArrayList from this JSON using Gson (don't forget your `TypeToken`!)
- Test this has all worked by printing out some strings from your new ArrayList
