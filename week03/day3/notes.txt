database table relationships

the relationships are between the rows of one table and the rows of another, not between the tables themselves.

1-1:
- pointless
- if for some reason you had two tables of customer details, and needed to link them
- better to just combine the data into a single table

1-many:
- a single customer can make many orders at the pizza shop
- each pizza order can only belong to a single customer
- foreign key in orders table is primary key in customers table

many - many:
- pizza menu
- orders
- customers

- a customer can order many pizzas
- a pizza can be included in many orders
- the orders table links the pizza menu and the customers




DRYing out
- extract the database interactions into their own class
- relates to database, so in db folder?


LOGICAL EXTENSION
The info is in sql, but we need to get it via Ruby.
- find all customer's previous orders
  - customer.pizza_orders()
    -> returns an array of PizzaOrder objects
        should be able to use ????
- find details of the customer associated with a particular order:
  - pizza_order.customer()
    -> returns a Customer object
        should be able to use @customer_id
