Pizza Shop ordering system.

A "model" is from the MVC concept: a pattern that applications use
Model: programmatic representation of the world i.e. logic, properties, etc.
View: what we see
Controller: bridge between model and view



Start with one model, one class, one table.

In ruby, the attributes of a class instance would be equivalent to the columns in an sql table.

create_db pizza_shop
db/pizza_shop.sql - file to define the table

Error / datatype checking should be done at the front end AND in the database e.g. order can't be negative.

SQL injection:
- an attack on the database
- an input could be changed to do more than intended - delete, read data they should not have access to, etc.
- you need to be careful how the sql query is sent from your app, as otherwise it could be modified by a user.
- SANITISE YOUR INPUT DATA!!
